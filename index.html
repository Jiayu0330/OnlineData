    <h1>An online source of data on my cause</h1>
    <p>The cause drives me to take this course is that I want to learn how
      website works and the ability to design web pages by myself, which has
      became more useful and necessary nowadays.<br>
      The data I found online is Young People Survey (2013) about their hobbies
      and interests. There were 32 items for them to choose how much they like
      each one. They could use 1 to represent "Not interested", and up to 5 to
      express "Very interested".<br>
      I counted how many times each integer appears and calculated the mean of
      each item. The data showed that young people were very interested in
      "Internet" (the mean is about 4.16). It reveals that the Internet has became
      more important in people's life, especially young people's life, and
      therefore supports my cause that learning about the Internet is a trend
      today. Young people who are interested in the Internet should learn how
      data and information are stored in the Internet and how to design your own
      web page to show something.<br>
